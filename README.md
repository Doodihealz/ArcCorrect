# ArcCorrect

3.3.5 Client addon

Makes red ? marks on items appear as their proper icons.

Minor bugs exist. Icons may need you to close and open your bags to refresh them after swapping spaces with other items.

This addon was made by Ethos, BitByte, and HalestormXV. I am simply posting it here for my own reference. **All** credit goes to those 3.
